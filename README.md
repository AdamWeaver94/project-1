## Website Mock up 


## Colour Palette

| Color             | Hex                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main headings colour (Custom) | ![#F6B000](https://via.placeholder.com/10/F6B000?text=+) #F6B000 |
| Main text colour (Azure) | ![#F0FFFF](https://via.placeholder.com/10/F0FFFF?text=+) #F0FFFF |
| Main backgrounud colour (Black)| ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/10/000000?text=+) #000000 |

- #F6B000 headings colour was inspired because of the viking obsession with gold.
- F0FFFF text colour helps viewers of the page read clearly by being a contrasting colour to the background.
- #000000 background colour was chosen for the dramatic and intrguing experince a viewer may experinece when first opeing the website.

## Font

I chose Cinzel as the font because of its ancient history look of text, giving a older but fitting style for the page. Although it may be more Roman looking, I still founud it suits the page throughout.


## Features

The website contains 3 pages. The first page consits of some breif information on the vikings. There is a gallery section that has a overlay function over each of the images informing you what god it is. Finally a contact page where a user can feeback of the website and what they would like included or overall experience.

## Header

The header is reponsive throughout all screen sizes on devices. On a desktop the navigation tabs locate at the top right of the page. While on smaller devices, I wanted to keep the nav bar the same but had to adjust the size to fit underneather the header logo. I took the inspiration from the Code Institute Love Running project as best suited the layout I wanted.

## Footer

The footer is also reponsive throught all device screens. I wanted to kepp the icons in the centre on the screen and keep it simply and clear. This was also inspiration from the Love Running project but modified myself to work.
