                <p>The runes were created in the Roman era to write the earliest forms of the Germanic language. They were eventually used by the Norse, Anglo-Saxons and Germans. For over a thousand years, the runes evolved into writing styles that fit the needs of contemporary Germanic culture.

                    The secrets of reading and writing were also believed to hold deeper secrets. The runes were costly associated with magic. Whether used on charms or invoked by gods, the Norse and other Germanic people believed that the runes were connected to divine powers. After hundreds of years of practical use, runes are once again being written in charms, spells and prayers.
