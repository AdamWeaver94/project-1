      <h3>Runes</h3>
      <p>
        The runes were created in the Roman era to write the earliest forms of
        the Germanic language. They were eventually used by the Norse,
        Anglo-Saxons and Germans. For over a thousand years, the runes evolved
        into writing styles that fit the needs of contemporary Germanic
        culture. The secrets of reading and writing were also believed to hold
        deeper secrets. The runes were closely associated with magic. Whether
        used on charms or invoked by gods, the Norse and other Germanic people
        believed that the runes were connected to divine powers. After
        hundreds of years of practical use, runes are once again being written
        in charms, spells and prayers.

      <h3>Weapons</h3>
      <p>
        In the Viking Age a number of different types of weapons were used:
        swords, axes, bows and arrows, lances and spears. The Vikings also
        used various aids to protect themselves in
        combat: shields, helmets and chain mail. The weapons that Vikings
        possessed depended on their economic capacity. Swords were the costly
        weapons of the elite, whereas axes and lances were affordable to the
        warriors of the broader population. There are however, variations in
        the preservation of the various types of weapons and equipment. For
        instance, relatively large numbers of swords and axes have survived
        until today, whilst remains of helmets and chain mail are extremely
        rare.

      <h3>Longships</h3>
      <p>
        Longships were naval vessels made and used by the Vikings from
        Scandinavia and Iceland for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare
        during the Viking Age. The longship's design evolved over many years,
        as seen in the Nydam and Kvalsund ships. The character and appearance
        of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boatbuilding
        traditions until today.
